# My Python Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my personal journey through learning Python â€” from writing my first "Hello World" to understanding data structures, algorithms, recursion, and building real projects.

Each folder represents a milestone â€” a step forward in my growth as a programmer.

## ðŸ“š Sections:

- **1_Hello_World**: My first steps into programming
- **2_Basics**: Learning variables, conditionals, and loops
- **3_Data_Structures**: Arrays, Strings, and Hashmaps
- **4_Algorithms**: Solving problems efficiently
- **5_LinkedLists_and_Trees**: Exploring more complex structures
- **6_Recursion**: Thinking deeper, solving smarter
- **7_Projects**: Applying skills to real ideas

This is just the beginning. ðŸš€  
I believe the best way to master programming is through consistent learning, solving, and building â€” and this journey continues every day.
